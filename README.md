Tutorial React.js app for better undestanding following concepts. 


## REDUX - A JavaScript library which allows React applications to extract ther data into on giant store
## THREE STEPS TO ADDING REDUX - * Define a redux constant
   	       	  	         * Add an Action Creator
				 * Amend or add a Reducer
## REDUX CONSTANTS - Constants that allow actions and reducers in redux to listen to the same type to ensure that it recognizes
data.
## ACTION CREATORS - methods that create and return actions for reducer to manipulate the redux store.
## ACTIONS - the plain JavaScript object that Action Creators return. Must include a type parameter with a
Redux constant and a certain data payload.
## REDUCERS - extract the Redux logic for the store into functions that handle actions and return pieces of the state.
## PROVIDER - a component at the root of your redux application that provides the redux store globally.
## _mapDispatchToProps_ - allows reducers in the redux store to become accessible within React Components through _this.props_ .
## _mapStateToProps_ - a redux method that allows action creators to store within _this.props_ in React Components.
## _bindActionCreators_ - a redux method that allows action creators to store within this.props in React Componets.
## Cookies - string names that map string values stored on the browser. Allows applications to keep a local history
of data on a browser.
